                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This week was a bit of a challenge. We had to use the 3D printers more, which was, of course, harder to grasp. Overall, this project was an interesting one when exploring the tools at our disposal, specifically TinkerCAD and PrusaSlicer, as it challenged my skill with using the programs and my creativity. Luckily, during this project, I got to make 2 separate and widely different prints: a phone stand and a halloween decoration.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Originally, I was on Thingiverse and I was looking for something that combined my interests with something more practical. During my search, I saw a lot of my peers were looking for decorations or something of the sort. Then, I was talking to Dean, since I was getting stumped in my search, and he said “just look for something you like, like an anime or something.” The first one that came to mind was One Piece, so I searched it up mid-conversation. I then had the thought “what if I found a transponder snail,” which is the communication technology in the world of One Piece; eventually, my mind thought, “what if I could connect my phone to it?” I looked up “transponder snail” on Thingiverse and the first thing that popped up was a phone stand. I quickly downloaded the design and got to work on TinkerCAD. In TinkerCAD, I was thinking of how I could modify an already functional design. I thought, “what if I added another charging port?” I then added one for my Apple Watch using the shapes available. Since we ran out of Prusa’s for printing, I was assigned to a Raise3D printer. I downloaded Ideamaker and  quickly uploaded the design. I kept the infill the same, since we just had to make a really long print and the total print time ended up being 15 hours and 32 minutes. I used a white PLA filament with 15% grid infill. The final result was very strong and sturdy, but a little smaller than what I was expecting. It was small enough to hold my phone and watch and the wires necessary to plug the devices in fit very well.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For my second print, I wanted to create something more decorative but still commemorative of this class! Therefore, I landed on making a unique Benchy. Since Halloween is a month away, I’ve decided to prep my decorations by making a Spooky Benchy. I wanted to make this into an older ship so it would look cooler. I started by importing a 3D Benchy file onto TinkerCAD on my iPad. From there, I used the drawing tool to add holes that would serve as cracks and shapes that would be more decorative. I added a miniBenchy to the Bow of the ship, so it would have a cool head piece, and I added a customized anchor on the left side of the ship. Then, I changed up some features by extending the Benchy and changing the chimney. After I finished up my design on TinkerCAD, I uploaded it to PrusaSlicer and sliced it up. I wanted to experiment with the infill types, so I edited it to 10% with a Honeycomb pattern, since that seemed to be the most efficient. The print time ended up being around 5.5 hours, which was relatively fast for a print that should have taken a long time. I also intentionally used the PrusaMini that was loaded with a silk-composite PLA at a lower temperature so that I would be able to retain some stringiness for “webs.” This was purely a decorative decision. The final result was not as stable because of the infill and material type, as the pieces weren't able to fully connect. I easily chipped off the mini-Benchy from the Bow and produced a small crack in the front of the ship just by playing around with it. I also used too low of a temperature because there was too much stringiness. It is good to know how to play with the material type and I am glad I was able to experiment with this.</p>
