                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This project was very efficient. This week, I worked with Tristan Boyer and the two of us were able to multitask while focusing on this project with ease. It was a very fun and understandable project that helped train the skills we’ve worked on with the Raise and Prusa printers and software while also gaining motor skills that help us put together parts of the E-NABLE hand. Also, looking at the hand’s components as separate pieces and then trying to figure out how they fit together and why was really helpful in understanding how components work together to form larger parts of a print and I will most likely use the same mechanisms that were used here in my future prints.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We started the assignment by printing everything but the palm of the left hand in Professor Roger’s lab’s Raise3D, since we ran out of space in the classroom. The next day, I picked up the print and put it in the classroom. I also started printing the palm on one of the PrusaMinis so we ended up using both IdeaMaker and PrusaSlicer. When we got to class, we had all of the components and so we were ready to assemble.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Full honesty, Tristan and I did not use the instruction video to assemble the E-nable hand. We did everything by eye and our own intuition and that ended up working out fine! We found the instructions only for tying the ropes but that was one of the last steps. Assembling the fingers and putting in the clips was really easy and made a lot of intuitive sense. We ended up switching out one of the fingers with a spare so we had more color variety on our final product. The hardest part of the assembly process was definitely the tying of the strings with the correct tension in order to make the hand pull together properly. It was a struggle but overall it felt very accomplishing to finish everything. I looked at the physical manual later in the project by myself and it seemed to me that the video was much more descriptive and a lot of the information stuck better by connecting the dots visually and audibly.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In regards to the last part of the assignment, which was brainstorming how we could model the hand in order to be used for a specific task, I wanted to think of how we could add a locking system in the fingers in order to complete different tasks. The tasks that I originally had in mind were sporting events and utilizing everyday electronics. I was envisioning a closed mechanism in order to take stress off of muscles and make each individual finger lockable. The way that it would work would be that the user would stress the fingers into the positions necessary and after they are locked, they would no longer need to use muscles to tense those fingers. Let’s give the example of golf, tennis, badminton; a person needs to hold the club or racket, so the user would tense the muscles to make the fingers grasp the club or racket and then lock them when it is done. This would keep the object from flying from their hand. Another example would be swimming; the user could lock their four fingers, excluding their thumb, in order to create a more hydrodynamic position for their hand. Finally, in regards to typing, the user would be able to lock their pointer finger on their hand in order to be able to type, lock their thumb to use a trackpad, and unlock/relock both when they need to use a mouse.</p>
