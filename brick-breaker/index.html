      This project was one of the most enjoyable projects we did this year. The ability to collaborate on one IDE allowed our group to be able to work through problems together.
      By being able to work at the same time, we were able to complete the project in a way that was both efficient and fun. The recorded code-a-longs very effectively helped us
      find a starting point for each part of the project. They gave us a frame of reference for how the code was supposed to work. Once we knew it worked, we were able to add our
      own personal touches to it. Overall, this final project shows how far we've come from the first classes, allowing us to work through difficulties as a team and get creative
      with our work. This project is a far cry from the much simpler work we did at the beginning of the year, showing that over the course of this class we were able to get a much
      better handle on the various languages we learned and the knowledge we retained from each that allowed us to succeed here.
