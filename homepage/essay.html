              <li>The Riegelmann Boardwalk is an essential part of Coney Island. It’s useful for moving from one neighborhood to another, it’s used to get to the beach and amusement parks, and it’is just a nice place to be. Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to think about Coney Island or Brighton Beach without thinking about the boardwalk. Growing up here, I visit it almost every day. During the summer, I would come here with my family and relatives to go to the beach, aquarium, or Luna Park. I would take my friends there to explore more of the area. My parents and I would gocome there to eat ice cream on nice days and hot corn on windy ones. I went to Bat Mitzvah after Bat Mitzvah to the countless restaurants that open up there. I would go with my Grandpa to the jetties on the beach and we would go to the very end and just sit there. I walked from end to end time and time again with many different people and it never got old. I would see it in my old apartment and I would always think about going there again. The boardwalk is a very nostalgic place.</li>
              <li>The Boardwalk is vast and broad as it stretches almost across the whole peninsula. It starts at the edge of Brighton and Manhattan Beach and goes all the way to the beginning of Seagate. The Riegelmann Boardwalk is primarily made of wooden planks arranged in a chevron pattern. Its width ranges from 50 to 80 feet (15 to 24 m) wide and is raised 14 feet (4.3 m) above sea level. The boardwalk connects several amusement areas and attractions on Coney Island, including the New York Aquarium, Luna Park, Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, and MCU Park. It has also become an icon of Coney Island, with numerous appearances in the visual arts, music, and film. The Coney Island waterfront was originally subdivided among several private entities who erected barriers. Plans for a Coney Island boardwalk were first discussed in the late 1890s as a means of uniting the different sections of Coney Island, and as a revitalization project for these areas. The boardwalk, designed by Philip P. Farley, was named after Brooklyn borough president Edward J. Riegelmann, who led its construction. The Riegelmann Boardwalk's first portion opened in 1923, with further extensions in 1926 and 1941, as well as several modifications and repairs throughout the 20th century. After NYC Parks unsuccessfully attempted to repair the boardwalk with concrete in the early 21st century, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Riegelmann Boardwalk a city landmark in 2018.</li>
              <li>Usually, most tourists come in from Ocean Parkway or the beginning of Coney Island due to the convenient locations of the train stations nearby. There they encounter hundreds of more tourists and, depending on the day, month, or season might even see some events right alongside the boardwalk. Usually, during the summer, and specifically around the end of August, there are many Latinx and Hispanic people dancing and playing music to their heart’s content. Once you pass them, you could head along to the beach, but then you would miss out on all of the fun amusements there are. If you walk east, you would be going to Brighton, which is usually where all of the Russian and Ukrainian restaurants are and where you would be able to see a bunch of grandparents and teenagers in the same area. If you go west, you would be heading towards Seagate, which is a gated community. On the way to Seagate, you would see plenty of restaurants and a bunch of people running shirtless and, if it’s the winter, you would see the Coney Island Polar Bears, who are the swim team that swims during the winter. You would also pass the steeplechase pier and Luna Park and the big skydiving pink thing that gives Coney Island its iconic look, usually, after that it’s just a bunch of locals just enjoying a walk during the day.</li>
              <li>The Boardwalk can also be split up into parts based on the materials that make it up. On the far east side, the boardwalk has more plastic because it is newer for the buildings next to it. Walking on the plastic makes you feel very active because of all of the static rushings through your body. When you walk there with your friends and you zap them, you get this intense feeling of childhood and nostalgia. After that, there is wood with a few replaced boards because there was no need for change. Brighton Beach is a very old neighborhood with very old people. They hate change. The only reason they fled to America was that they felt like they had to. They feel that as the years go by, nothing will change for them because they have already passed their peak. They have grown old and they feel like there is no need for something there. The people that live on this part also grew up in the USSR in deep poverty, so they understand that if something’s not broken, there is no need to fix it. Closer to Ocean Parkway, the boardwalk is made up of stone and newer planks, with old planks following it again. The stones were added in after Hurricane Sandy when all of the sand on the beach stacked up into piles and piles on the Boardwalk. The planks that were there before we’re too old for use because if they tried to pull them out, they would just snap like twigs. The oOld planks being replaced close to the sea gate are mostly for the image of the buildings beside them. Unlike the East side of the Boardwalk, the west is more raggedy and has less of an active feel. It’s dark and gloomy there. You get chills when you walk there, even if it’s 100 degrees outside and you feel like you are going to melt. They try to fix it up there, but that place just feels… dull.</li>
              <li>The Riegelmann Boardwalk is different from other boardwalks because of the symbolism it carries for our community and the culture tied into it. The BW represents a constant for the people of South Brooklyn, as it is always there, but the changes in the types of materials are representative of the changes we all experience and the additions we make to the neighborhood.  Even though it might be different from when it was first built, the Boardwalk has built significance to the neighborhoods, and area, as a whole.</li>
