                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Finding a client was the most challenging project we’ve had so far. My group decided to find turtles with disabilities related to their shells so we could make a prosthetic for them, which is much much MUCH harder than expected. Our ideal client is a turtle who needs a shell, but many wildlife conservation sites near the area don’t have the animals that we would need as clients. This meant that we had to start asking for referrals to veterinary clinics and wildlife rescue sites as opposed to the conservation sites. We sent our first email to the Massachusetts Audubon center on 10/31.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The questions we asked our prospective clients were pretty simple. We asked the clients the following questions: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> How big is the injury? </li>
                                        <li> How did the injury happen? </li>
                                        <li> What does the shell look like for the species? </li>
                                        <li> How long ago was the injury? </li>
                                        <li> What is the turtle’s daily routine? </li>
                                        <li> What is the personality of the turtle? </li>
                                        <li> What is the age of the turtle? What is its background? </li>
                                    </ul> 
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We have yet to meet with a specific client but the outreach has been pretty successful when getting referrals and other people to talk to.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When we meet with a specific client, we hope to discuss the needs of the specific turtle. The meeting wouldn’t be longer than an hour and could be virtual. If we are meeting with a veterinary clinic, I’d prefer that we meet in person. The first meeting would be a general discussion of what is possible and what we need to achieve. The second meeting would be more of an examination and possible scanning. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We 3D printed two prototypes of shells and two prototypes of small rodent laryngoscopes, specifically after emailing with a professor at Tufts, who suggested we switch over to helping Biological/Animal rescue laboratories that would need help with 3D printing specific tools. A lot of the other responses that we got from different Animal Care clinics, Wildlife preservation clinics, and veterinary clinics were just referrals and giving us other resources that would probably have a turtle that we could help.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Since we haven’t yet found a client, we still decided to complete 2 design thinking methodologies. We chose to do a Needs diagram and a Impact-Feasibility chart. The needs diagram was done with the focus that turtles were our client; we split the general needs that we wrote down into 4 benefits. Things like head protection, camouflage, and organ protection fell under the safety category; this connected to comfort, which included swimming speed, shell fit, and shelter. Finally, interactions with other turtles were connected to the categories of natural behaviors turtles exhibit, like mating and fighting. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We reused the post-its from the Needs diagram to start the Impact-Feasibility chart. Our ideas focused on different needs/benefits. We thought of changing the material and making the shell clear to help with Vitamin D absorption and we thought of changing the texture to help with mating and swim speed. The most feasible and impactful was to fit the endoskeleton and to create a shell that would protect the turtle. Mud and water resistance was also related to the change in material, making it both feasible and impactful.</p>
