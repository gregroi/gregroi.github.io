                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It’s alarm clock time! I was super excited to get into this project because soldering was one of the things I was most excited about in this class. It was just such a foreign skill to me and I was curious on how the solder actually keeps the circuit working. The first time it worked, it actually felt like magic because it is drawn to heat. I loved learning this skill as it was so cool and is very useful! I was talking to other people and they fixed car headlights with soldering. It’s so impressive and I’m glad I am able to do it now.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Back to the actual alarm clock frame. We were given this assignment and I was watching Fionna and Cake, a cartoon spinoff of another show called Adventure Time, at the time, and in the show, everything in the reality of the original is changed to be more “mundane.” BMO, a little robot game console from the original series, was turned into an alarm clock in F&C, so I absolutely HAD to take this opportunity. Sophia agreed with my vision and so we quickly calculated all of the dimensions of the circuit board and got to work. We decided to split the work up by component, so I built the main body while Sophia worked on the circuit board and then the lid. Check out <a href="https://snposner.github.io/">her website</a> for more information.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I started by making a rectangular sketch for the size of the circuit board. Then I made a bigger one around it that would serve as the actual body. I guesstimated a lot of the shapes. I extruded the dimensions up also by eye. I made a very generic cover while Sophia was finishing up the circuit, so it only had the spaces for the number holes. I then added holes for the arms and set it off to print in a Raise3D. By the end of class, Sophia had finished the full circuit board and we were ready to start building.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When we came back to the next class… WE NOTICED THE HOLE WAS TOO SMALL! The lid fit perfectly, so we weren't too worried about that. Sophia and I quickly got back to Fusion. Sophia was going to work on the lid while I was going to work on the frame. I made some small changes, like cutting the bottom of the legs so that BMO could stand and making a bigger hole and small step so that we would have a “battery case.” Meanwhile, Sophia was adding more holes for the buttons and buzzer. Then… everything changed when we had the workshop. Sophia and I learned how to play with components and constraints and so we now had everything at our whim (in Fusion). She added buttons and I added arms. My arms did not print correctly, so they didn’t come out to the final version, BUT HER BUTTONS ARE MAGICAL!</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I really enjoyed working on this project with Sophia because it was very efficient and fast and we had a lot of quick problem solving. We had some small issues, including the balance of the alarm clock, buttons, and the wires of our circuit board breaking off and fraying, but overall, this experience was a great success! Thanks for teaching me how to solder :))</p>
