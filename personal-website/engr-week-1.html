                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Over the first week, we were tasked with constructing a 3D printer and printing a Benchy, which is a tiny boat designed to calibrate and test the limits of the PrusaMini 3D Printers. This was a very intuitive process and took us only 1.5 class periods to complete. I collaborated with Jonghyeon (Johnny) on the construction of the printer and the printing of the Benchy, as well as all further iterations.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It was a pretty intuitive process. We followed the instructions and went through each step one by one but tried to collaborate on multiple steps at the same time in order to complete the printer as efficiently as possible. Since most of the printer was already self assembled, our main challenge was just finding which screw and sticker corresponded to which place, as the instructions were a little confusing with the placement. We did finish building the printer quickly though, as it took less than one class. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When it was calibrated, we had a few more issues. At first, the printer was not followign all of our instructions, so it took longer to melt the filament and print our designs. We used the silk-composite PLA filament, which requires higher temperatures in order to print. We did not know this at first, so we were trying to match the same distance and temperature as other groups. This created less structurally stable prints, which came out with a few deformities. There was greater stringiness and a lot of excess filament that was used.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first print, which was the regular 3D Benchy found on Thingiverse, came out very stringy and with a lot of excess material. In my opinion, it looked like it had a lot of cobwebs and was, therefore, an older ship. The actual design itself was pretty structurally stable and is still holding. Due to its different filament type, it was a little bit more flexible. In reflection, we should have raised the temperature, as that would have created less strings and a more solid ship, but the actual Benchy itself was pretty stable.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The second print was a mini-3D Benchy, around 1/4th of the size of the original print. This one came out pretty durible, but because it was much smaller and we didnâ€™t change the temperature, it ended up breaking. The supports for this benchy were smaller, since the actual print was smaller. This meant that it was much easier to crush and needed greater reinforcement, whether through infill, structural support, or thicker layers. Overall, it was a good lesson in stability and understanding the stress behind our 3D builds.</p>
