                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Team turtle made a lot of iterations during this project. Since we were multi-tasking this project with following leads from connections and Project 6, we were basing our different iterations on different types of turtles and tortoises, both on land and in the water. We took the different types of shells and printed them in different materials. Over the course of a week or so, we put the different types of shells under different stresses and forces in order to see how they would endure under different conditions.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Let’s go back to our needs. Our needs diagram was done with the focus that turtles were our client; we split the general needs that we wrote down into 4 benefits. Head protection, camouflage, and organ protection fell under the safety category. This connected to comfort, which included swimming speed, shell fit, and shelter. Interactions with other turtles were connected to the categories of natural behaviors turtles exhibit, like mating and fighting; this category included having a nice-looking shell that was also strong. Absorbing vitamin D was necessary for internal health, which was our final category. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our first two prototypes were box turtle shells. We made them originally to show to clients, but then decided to use them as our iterations. They were both made out of PLA on the Raise3D E2 printers with 15% infill and supports; they came out very well and were very sturdy. We tested these through drop tests; we only conducted drop tests on one of the shells so we could keep the other as a control. We started by dropping from my arm’s height, which is around five feet; both shells survived this drop and did not make any dents on the shell. The second drop test was down the stairs. One flight of stairs in Abelson is around an 8 ft drop. Since we dropped it down from the fourth floor to the third, we dropped the shell a total of 16 ft; a small layer on the bottom of the shell popped off, but otherwise, there was no more excessive damage. Our final drop test was from Abelson 3 to Abelson LL, which is 6 flights of stairs or 48 feet. This created a dent in a layer close to the top and took off most of the bottom layers. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After the drop test, Dean had an idea for our final project. With Vincent’s help, he shrank plastic around one of the box turtle shells. The plastic we shrunk will simulate the turtle’s body; all of the different molds, scans, and scutes we make on top of it will work as the shell. We peeled off the top and bottom layers that were still hanging on. We ended up scanning the shell that we broke using the Artec 3D scanners. For our final project, we will try to deconstruct the turtle shell.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In between the box turtle shell printing, we also decided to play around with PETG, in which we printed a small bird model. This model wasn’t useful in the long run, but was useful to test PETG. This material could be printed a lot smaller and thinner and still be extremely durable yet elastic. We also had a clearer color filament, so it was a little translucent. </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The prototype after that was a full turtle scan; this was printed on the Raise3D E2CF printers with nylon. We conducted the same drop tests we did with the box turtle shells, but this time testing the nylon material. Nylon was sufficiently stronger than the PLA used for the original box turtle shells. First test didn’t dent the model; the second test knocked off one of the legs at around a midpoint; the third test knocked off two more legs. We are planning to redo this experiment but with the same conditions as the other box turtle shells, since the mass distribution on this print was fundamentally different from the shells. Although, because of the mass being located primarily in the shell, the same impact was felt; the only reason the legs broke was due to their layer thickness being smaller than the shells. Either way, we need to conduct further investigation on material type in order to come to a more solid conclusion.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our next prototype was a sea turtle shell. This was a different type of shell   from the box turtle but was also printed on the Raise3D E2CF printers. Because we already tested nylon with a gravity test and because sea turtles are unlikely to have applied or gravitational forces as the reason for shell breaks, we decided to do a buoyancy test. We got a bin of water and placed the shell inside; it floated well because it wasn’t dense and full of air. With a turtle attached, it’s unlikely that the shell would sink any further than it did but would allow for ease of movement. We left the shell for around 30 minutes and saw that it collected some water afterwards, but its structure and strength was the same. After the shell fully dried, it returned to the same state it was before being submerged.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our newest prototype was a tortoise shell. We were originally going to print this on the Gigabot but we didn’t because of issues with the printer. This was printed with PLA and was just to see how density would affect the type of print available. The extra weights on the turtle didn’t change much in terms of weight and wouldn’t slow a turtle down.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our next steps are to continue making prints with different materials and just creating different types of shells and cracks in order to have a diversity of problems to solve. We will be using the different material prints for our final documentation in order to describe which materials would be the most beneficial for the animals' prosthetics. The different cracks will be used for the final project, as we are going to be filling them in through the use of Rhino and Blender, which we have access to in the library.</p>
